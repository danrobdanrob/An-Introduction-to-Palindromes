#user inputs a start number and a higher end number
#numbers between start and end are made into a list which contains all the numbers between them
#convert the integers in the list into strings
#check if each of those numbers is palindromic (they are the same sliced forwards and backwards)
#each time a number within the list is palindromic add it to a new list
#return the list
#print output in plain text form.

#notes: 
#initially tried to remove non palindromes from the list but found i was changing the index of the list as i iterated through it so instead changed to new list
#between and stringbetween could be on the same line
